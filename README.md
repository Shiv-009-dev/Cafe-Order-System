# Cafe-Order-System
The Cafe Ordering System is a simple Python program designed to simulate the process of ordering items at a cafe. This project provides users with a menu of available items, allows them to select multiple items to order, and calculates the total cost. The system is built with a user-friendly interface that ensures easy navigation and efficient order management.

How It Works:
1) The program begins by welcoming the user and displaying the caf√©'s menu.
2) The user is prompted to enter the name of the item they wish to order.
3) After each selection, the program checks if the item is available and, if so, adds the price to the running total.
4) The user is then asked if they want to order another item. This process repeats until the user indicates they are finished.
5) Finally, the program outputs the total amount that the user needs to pay.
